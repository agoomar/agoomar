# Hello 👋🏽
## Hi, I'm Ashish! I'm a software engineer who loves to game and I am passionate about learning new and upcoming technological changes within software development. 
- My interest is in full-stack web development and expertise is in front-end development.
  - I love to work with React and I am learning more about the other frameworks such as Vue and Angular to broaden my skills as a web developer.
- I am currently attending a coding bootcamp called Lambda School. 
  - Lambda School has helped me realize what I want to ultimately do career wise and to pursue this interest that I have with coding. It's something that I am very passionate about and I can't wait to broaden my developer skills and work on amazing projects!
